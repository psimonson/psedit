===========================================================
				This is a simple text editor written in C using ncurses.
By me (Philip R. Simonson) now I have made this program,
because I wanted to show people the right way of making a
text editor. This text editor uses minimal resources or
at least I tried to use minimal resources. Because I want
this to work on even a machine that has 640KB memory.
Enough explaination of why I made this. Below is a list
of stuff that is implemented currently. Then, following
is a list of the keyboard shortcuts.
============================================================
                        FEATURES
============================================================
 - Normal text input.
 - Delete and backspace keys.
 - Arrow keys for navigation through the buffer.
 - Home and end keys for the start and end of line.
 - Return and tabstop keys.
 - Lastly file saving.
============================================================
                   KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
============================================================
 Ctrl+Q - Quit the text editor.
 Ctrl+S - Save the current file.
============================================================
                       KNOWN BUGS
============================================================
 - Return key bug (have to press 'Return' twice to go down
   a line of text.
------------------------------------------------------------
 - Text scrolling bug (scrolling down all the way it messes
   up the linecount and skiplines) so, it doesn't scroll
   properly after a couple times of scrolling.
