   This is a simple text editor written in C using ncurses.
By me (Philip R. Simonson) now I have made this program,
because I wanted to show people the right way of making a
text editor. This text editor uses minimal resources or
at least I tried to use minimal resources. Because I want
this to work on even a machine that has 640KB memory.
Enough explaination of why I made this. Below is a list
of stuff that is implemented currently. Then, following
is a list of the keyboard shortcuts.
